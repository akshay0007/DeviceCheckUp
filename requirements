1) Design a Serverless solutionÂ for a system that receives data feeds continuously from IoT devices in the field with the following shape (JSON):
{
    "deviceid" : "96543150-c695-4fdb-89cf-749abfb305b7",
    "temperature" : 54.98,
    "humidity" : 32.43,
    "model" : "Series-V",
    "timestamp" : "2021-02-01T21:12:09Z",

    "sensors" : [ "LIDAR", "THERMAL" ],
    "position" : {
        "latitude" : 47.615694,
        "longitude" : -122.3359976
    }
}
2) System will receive data via exposed REST API POST /v1/feeds
3) System needs to persist data in DynamoDB table
4) System needs to send notification when payload includes "THERMAL" sensor

AWS Services to use:
- API Gateway
- Lambda
- DynamoDB
- SNS
